# Implementation of Basic Data Structures

## This is my own implementation of simple data structures
- It's incomplete
- It may (surely) contain bugs
- It may have awful implementation
- No Guarantees
- It's free to use :)

## How to build
##### NOTE: Assuming you're on a linux machine, if you use Windows, ask GOD for help.
- Download `cmake` , `g++`
- Run the following commands
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
- Don't forget to add your favorite test cases to the `main.cpp` file.
